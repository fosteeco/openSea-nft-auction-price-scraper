# Simple scraper to get NFT Auction price

The example I used in here is for this NFT: https://opensea.io/assets/0xb4d06d46a8285f4ec79fd294f78a881799d8ced9/6838

Simply change the url in the script or pass the url suffix into the getNFTData() function. (url suffix is the string after assets/)

Fetched date is not correct format, simply plug it in here to verify that it's wrong:
